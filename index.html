	  </ul>
	  <h3>The rest just Happens</h3>
	  <p>
	    Code blocks aren't runnable by default. Because you might
	    want to put crazy non runnable code in there. Like,
	    html.

	     You can specify a codemirror theme as long as you include
	    htmlthe stylesheet for it by setting the theme attribute.
